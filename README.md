This project focuses on building an advanced AI model to forecast Delhi’s daily electricity demand as well as peak load values. Using a combination of historical electricity consumption, temperature variations, and solar generation data, the system applies machine learning techniques to capture patterns and generate highly reliable short-term predictions. 
The workflow includes thorough data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature engineering, model selection, training, and performance evaluation. After training, the system visualizes Actual vs. Predicted demand through intuitive plots, making it easier to understand forecasting accuracy and trends📊
This model is designed to support power utilities and grid operators by improving load planning, resource optimization, and decision-making. The project also provides a foundation for building a real-time UI dashboard and deployment on cloud platforms for continuous monitoring✨
